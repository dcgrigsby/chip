## Advantages

"In contrast to Hummers’method, the [Tour] method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled." [2]

"[C]hemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity." [2]

## Warnings

"Reactions that will explode if they exceed 55 degrees" [1]

## Graphites

Intend to use the flake graphite as described in [2]. If that doesn't produce expected results, will use [Bay Carbon, SP-1 graphite](https://www.baycarbon.com/SP1Summary.htm) from [3] - the data sheet shows particle sizes follow a gaussian curve, so it's not clear to me what size filter(s) to use.

## Materials and Equipment

Centrifuge (4000rpm capable), and centrifuge tubes with enough volume to hold filtrate   

Heated plate with magnetic stirrer, with stirring rod

Graphite ﬂakes (Sigma-Aldrich, ~150μm ﬂakes)

Potassium permanganate

96(-98%) concentrated sulfuric acid

75% concentrated phosphoric acid

Large beaker sized to hold graphite, potassium permanganate, and acids

Lid for large beaker

Small beaker sized to hold acids

Glass stirring rod

Stir bar for magnetic stirrer

Ice made from deionized water

Large glass cylinder sized to hold ice, "browny, purple liquid", hydrogen peroxide

30% hydrogen peroxide [2; 1 might have said 35%]

Graduated eye dropper

Small beaker, sized for hydrogen peroxide

Metal U.S. Standard testing sieve (W.S. Tyler, 300μm) [2]

5 polyester ﬁber filters (Carpenter Co.; not sure which) [2]

PTFE membrane with 0.45μm pore size

30% hydrochloric acid

Ethanol

Ether

## "Tour Method"

### Schedule

12 hours for initial reaction; 20 hours for centrifuge steps; dry overnight

### Steps

Mix 3g graphite and 18 potassium permanganate (1:6 ratio) in large beaker.

Mix 360ml sulfuric acid and 40ml of phosphoric acid (9:1 ratio) in small beaker.

Start stirring the large beaker and slowly pour in acid. "You'll see it go green almost immediately." [1]  Temp will rise to about 35-40C. [2]

Stir covered at 50C for 12 hours, resulting in "browny, purple liquid." [1]  Leave to cool to room temperature.

Make ice from 400mm deionized water and add to large glass cylinder. Slowly pour in "browny, purple liquid" [1], add 3ml hydrogen peroxide using eye dropper and stir.  A "nice bright yellow graphene oxide" will form [1].

Sift mixture through testing sieve, then ﬁltered through polyester ﬁber.  

Centrifuge filtrate at 4000 rpm for 4 h.  Decant (pour off) supernatant (liquid on top).

Wash remaining solid with 200ml water.  Sift through sieve, filter through polyester fiber, and centrifuge as before.

Wash with 200ml of 30% hydrochloric acid.  Sift through sieve, filter through polyester fiber, and centrifuge as before.

Wash with 200ml of ethanol.  Sift through sieve, filter through polyester fiber, and centrifuge as before.

Wash once more with 200ml of ethanol.  Sift through sieve, filter through polyester fiber, and centrifuge as before.

[Coagulate](https://www.quora.com/What-is-coagulation-in-chemistry) with 200ml ether (resulting in a suspension) and filter over PTFE membrane.

Vacuum dry overnight.  (Is vacuum drying and vacuum desiccating the same?)

Produces 5.6g graphene oxide.
