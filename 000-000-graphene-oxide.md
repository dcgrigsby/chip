## Warnings

"Reactions that will explode if they exceed 55 degrees"

## Materials and Equipment

Heated plate with magnetic stirrer

[Bay Carbon, SP-1 graphite](https://www.baycarbon.com/SP1Summary.htm) [2]

Potassium permanganate

96(-98%) concentrated sulfuric acid

75% concentrated phosphoric acid

Large beaker sized to hold graphite, potassium permanganate, and acids

Lid for large beaker

Small beaker sized to hold acids

Glass stirring rod

Stir bar for magnetic stirrer

Ice made from deionized water

Large glass cylinder sized to hold ice, "browny, purple liquid", hydrogen peroxide

35% hydrogen peroxide

Graduated eye dropper

Small beaker, sized for hydrogen peroxide

XXX fill in with SP-1 micron number XXX micron mesh filter (mesh same size as graphite)

Polyester fiber filter

30% hydrochloric acid

Ethanol

## "Tour Method"

From [1] unless noted.

Mix 3g graphite and 18 potassium permanganate (1:6 ratio) in large beaker.

Mix 360ml sulphuric acid and 40ml of phosphoric acid (9:1 ratio) in small beaker.

Start stirring the large beaker and slowly pour in acid. "You'll see it go green almost immediately."  Temp will rise to about 40C.

Stir covered at 50C for 12 hours, resulting in "browny, purple liquid."  Leave to cool to room temperature.

Make ice from 400mm deionized water and add to large glass cylinder. Slowly pour in "browny, purple liquid", add 3ml hydrogen peroxide using eye dropper and stir.  A "nice bright yellow graphene oxide" will form

Filter through mesh filter to strain out residual graphite.

Refilter through polyester fiber.

Wash it with 200mm water, 200mm 30% hydrochloric acid, 200mm ethanol (mixed together? XXX research by reading Tour method paper XXX).

Expect 5.6g graphene oxide.
