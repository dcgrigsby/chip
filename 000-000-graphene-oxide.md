## Warnings

"Reactions that will explode if they exceed 55 degrees"

## Materials and Equipment

### Heated plate with magnetic stirrer

[Bay Carbon, SP-1 graphite](https://www.baycarbon.com/SP1Summary.htm) from [Large-area ultrathin films of reduced graphene oxide as a transparent and flexible electronic material](https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2008.83)

potassium permanganate

96(-98%) concentrated sulphuric acid

75% concentrated phosphoric acid

large beaker - sized to hold graphite, potassium permanganate, and acids

lid for large beaker

small beaker - sized to hold acids

glass stirring rod

stir bar for magnetic stirrer

ice from deionized water

large glass cylinder - sized to hold ice, "browny, purple liquid", hydrogen peroxide

35% hydrogen peroxide

graduated eye dropper

small beaker, sized for hydrogen peroxide

XXX fill in with SP-1 micron number XXX micron mesh filter (mesh same size as graphite)

polyester fiber filter

30% hydrochloric acid

ethanol

## "Tour Method"

mix 3g graphite and 18 potassium permanganate (1:6 ratio) in large beaker

mix 360ml sulphuric acid and 40ml of phosphoric acid (9:1 ratio) in small beaker

start stirring the large beaker and slowly pour in acid; "you'll see it go green almost immediately"; temp will rise to about 40C

stir covered at 50C for 12 hours; results in "browny, purple liquid"; leave to cool to room temperature

make ice, from 400mm deionized water, and add to large glass cylinder; slowly pour in "browny, purple liquid"; add 3ml hydrogen peroxide using eye dropper; stir and "nice bright graphene oxide" will form

filter through mesh filter to strain out residual graphite

refilter through polyester fiber

wash it with 200mm water, 200mm 30% hydrochloric acid, 200mm ethanol (mixed together? XXX research by reading Tour method paper XXX)

expect 5.6g graphene oxide
